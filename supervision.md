# Exercise 1
* Get the [DroidStore](https://github.com/MonkeyIsNull/DroidStore/tree/sup) with Supervisors up and running with iex
* Crash a process and check for restarts
* Launch :observer.start and check the links section of :hoth, :mose etc and their supervisors

* BONUS: ProgElixir has a stash implementation, it saves all the state
  from a crashing process to a 'stash' server. Read up, code up.
