# use the following data to answer the questions in this section

characters = [
  %{name: "Han",        type: :human,   rebel: true,    weight: 185},
  %{name: "Jabba",      type: :hutt,    rebel: false,   weight: 2200},

# Note that there is more than one correct answer for all of these!

# Question 1

* In one line of code, set a variable called wookie_name to the name of the wookie character

# Question 2

* In one line of code, set a variable called 'weight' to how much Han weighs

## Advanced (we haven't covered all of this yet, you'll likely need to read documentation)

# Question 3

* In one line of code, create a list of the names of the humans

# Question 4
