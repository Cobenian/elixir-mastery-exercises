## Macros exercise

* Write a macro that wraps an expression in a try block. Have it return the result of the expression
if the expression does not raise an error.  Have the macro take a second argument that is a default value.
The macro should log a warning and return the default value if an error is raised. The default value must not be evaluated if the expression does not raise an error.
